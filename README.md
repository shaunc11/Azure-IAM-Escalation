# Escalation by Design: How I Inherited Blob Access in Azure Without Direct Permissions

## The Challenge

In this project, I simulated a **real-world privilege escalation** in Azure. The goal: prove that a seemingly harmless user (`manager`) could access a private blob storage container through **nested group inheritance** ‚Äî without any direct role assignment.

## Environment Overview

**Azure Tenant**: Free-tier  
**Target User**: `manager`  
**Groups**: `MidLevelGroup`, `tempAdminGroup`, `StorageAccessGroup`  
**Resource**: Storage Account `ctfstorage12345`  
**Blob Container**: `ctf-container`  
**Flag File**: `flag.txt` (private, sensitive marker)

## Nested Group Design

I built an escalation chain using Azure AD Security Groups:

**manager**
->MidLevelGroup
  ->tempAdminGroup
      ->StorageAccessGroup (has *Storage Blob Data Contributor role*)

The role was only applied to `StorageAccessGroup`. `manager` only belonged to `MidLevelGroup`. If the inheritance worked, access would be silently escalated.

## ‚öîÔ∏è The Access Attempts

**Azure Portal**: ‚ùå ‚ÄúAccess Denied‚Äù  
**Browser URL**: ‚ùå ‚ÄúPublic Access Not Permitted‚Äù  
**Azure Storage Explorer**: ‚ùå No subscriptions found  
**Azure CLI**: ‚úÖ Eventual success

I tested access across several interfaces to validate propagation paths.

## Azure CLI: Proof of Access

**Once Azure AD had time to propagate (~45 minutes), I used the CLI to access the blob:**

az login --allow-no-subscriptions

az storage blob list \
  --account-name ctfstorage12345 \
  --container-name ctf-container \
  --auth-mode login \
  --output table
‚úÖ The output revealed flag.txt. Access was confirmed.

**I then downloaded it using:**

az storage blob download \
  --account-name ctfstorage12345 \
  --container-name ctf-container \
  --name flag.txt \
  --file ./flag_by_manager.txt \
  --auth-mode login

## üõ° Detection & Remediation

**What to monitor in the real world**:

- Run az role assignment list on critical resources
- Identify indirect role inheritance through nested groups
- Audit users with access to storage blobs using Check Access in IAM blade

**How to fix misconfigurations like this**:

- Flatten IAM group hierarchy when possible
- Avoid deeply nested roles without visibility
- Apply roles closer to the user/resource
- Implement Conditional Access and monitoring alerts

## IAM Takeaway
Even with proper group nesting and role assignment, Azure RBAC propagation lag caused up to 1 hour of invisible permission mismatch ‚Äî highlighting how slow privilege changes can expose security blind spots.
This is the kind of problem that‚Äôs hard to detect in the real world ‚Äî and exactly the kind of thing IAM engineers and SOC teams need to understand deeply.

## What I Learned
IAM isn't just about assigning roles ‚Äî it's about how they propagate and inherit

Azure‚Äôs delay in applying RBAC roles can create temporary access mismatches

Nested groups = power + risk. Every layer hides intent.
